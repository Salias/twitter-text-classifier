##Text Classifier for Twitter data

Simple class to build, evaluate, tune and get a production-ready Text Classifier for Twitter data.

The example data is part of my research and will train the classifier to determine weather a tweet is traffic-related.

To use your own data, place a csv file into the "data" forlder. The csv file should contain at least 2 columns named by default "text" and "label".
These columns contains the text of the tweet and the label (normally binary "0" of "1").

More detailed documentation soon !!

Happy Classification !! :D
